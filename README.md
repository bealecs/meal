## A web app for finding an optimal meal suggestion for you based off of personal preferences, previous favorites, or a randomly generated suggestion.

#### Thank you for checking out my repository for my latest project. I have recently started throwing together this web app as an extension to a previous project. I plan to have full spectrum usage with this web app, from the front-end to the back-end: including account creation + database storing meal favorites. 

#### The idea originally started as a project to create a random meal suggestion. As seen in my meal repository, my wife and I are very indecesive. I created this random meal suggestion app in efforts to combat our indecesiveness; this way, whenever we don't know what to eat, we can just grab a suggestion from this app. However, after browsing for a new project to dive into, I decided to expand on my previous work with this. 

#### In the future, I will be adding more things like stated before, such as meals recommended based off preferred meal styles and meal favorites history. I am looking forward to the end result.
